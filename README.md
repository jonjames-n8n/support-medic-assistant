## File Locations

- **Exported workflows:** `~/Downloads/<workspace>-workflows-<date>.json.gz`
- **Backup exports:** `~/Downloads/<workspace>-workflows-backup-<date>.zip`
- **Log downloads:** `~/Downloads/<workspace>-<logtype>-<timestamp>.txt`
- **Log bundles:** `~/Downloads/<workspace>-logs-bundle-<timestamp>.tar.gz`
- **Tool location:** Wherever you placed `support_medic_tool.py`

## Tips

### Quick Access Setup

For fastest access, I recommend:

```bash
# 1. Make executable
chmod +x support_medic_tool.py

# 2. Move to bin
sudo cp support_medic_tool.py /usr/local/bin/cloudmedic

# 3. Create short alias
echo 'alias cm="cloudmedic"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Now run with just:
cm
```

### Working with Multiple Workspaces

You can change workspace without restarting:
- Select option `13` to enter new workspace/cluster
- Or quit and restart the tool

### Safety Features

The tool includes safety measures:
- Confirms destructive operations
- Takes backup before deactivating workflows
- Shows counts before bulk operations
- Displays current workspace context
- Requires CONFIRM to change owner email

### Database Shell Tips

When using option `11` (Database troubleshooting) → option `9` (Raw SQL shell):
```sql
-- Common queries
SELECT id, name, active FROM workflow_entity;
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM execution_entity GROUP BY status;
.tables          -- List all tables
.schema <table>  -- Show table structure
.quit            -- Exit shell
```

### Execution Status Checker (v1.2)

Access via Database Troubleshooting → Option 8:
- **Waiting executions** - Detects "year 3000" stuck executions
- **Pending executions** - Warns about crashloop risk (>100 pending)
- **Running executions** - Shows long-running executions
- **Error analysis** - Groups errors by workflow
- **All statuses summary** - Color-coded overview

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: kubectx"

Install kubectx:
```bash
brew install kubectx  # macOS
```

### "Could not find pod"

Verify:
- Workspace name is correct
- You're connected to VPN
- Cluster exists and you have access

### "Permission denied"

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x support_medic_tool.py
```

### Downloads not working

The tool saves to `~/Downloads` by default. If you want a different location, edit line 46 in the script:
```python
self.downloads_dir = Path.home() / "Downloads"  # Change this
```

## Advanced: Customization

### Change Download Directory

Edit line 46:
```python
self.downloads_dir = Path("/path/to/your/folder")
```

### Add Custom Operations

Add your own menu option in the `show_main_menu()` method:
```python
("17", "My custom operation", self.my_custom_function),
```

Then create the function:
```python
def my_custom_function(self):
    self.print_header("My Custom Operation")
    # Your code here
    input(f"\n{Colors.CYAN}Press Enter to continue...{Colors.END}")
```
